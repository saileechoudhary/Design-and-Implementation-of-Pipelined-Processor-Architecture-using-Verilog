# Design-and-Implementation-of-Pipelined-Processor-Architecture-using-Verilog
A five stage pipe-lined processor architecture on ModelSim simulator. It comprises of the data path and control unit for a pipelined system, which executes given set of instructions. The unit also handles data, structural and control hazards along with implementation of branch-prediction unit.
